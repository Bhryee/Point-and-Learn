<h2>Sprint 1 Notes</h2>

- The team name was decided, tasks were assigned to team members, and the project idea was finalized.</br>
- Our daily scrum meetings were conducted via WhatsApp and Google Meet.</br>
- Miro and Trello were used for project management.</br>
- The logo was designed with the help of Canva.</br>
- The README section on GitHub has been started.</br>
- For UI designs (login page, home page, menu and settings pages, and sample application screens), Figma was used; care was taken to ensure that color selections and designs matched the logo.</br>
- To encourage learning and make the app more professional, English language and email-based login were preferred.</br>

<h2>Scoring Logic</h2>

<h4>Estimated story points to be completed for Sprint 1: 100</h4>

The overall project workload was distributed with a total target of 400 points.

- Sprint 1 (Ideation, Planning & UI/UX Design): Assigned 100 points, reflecting its focus on conceptual development and foundational planning activities.
- Sprint 2 (Development & AI Integration): Allocated 150 points, due to its emphasis on coding, implementation of AI models, and a more intensive workflow.
- Sprint 3 (Review & Finalization): Also assigned 150 points, as it covers the comprehensive review of all components, debugging, and the preparation of finalized project deliverables.

This distribution ensured a balanced and goal-oriented project management approach across all sprints.
